# Rado's Toolbox

Files I copy from project to project. Most of them single files who don't deserve their own gem, npm/bower package.

## Usage

* Check the markdown file with documentation
* Use the [rench gem](https://github.com/mrmicahcooper/rench) command or use ```curl``` to get it

## Credits

I saw this idea from Micah Cooper in [Put your programming tools in a Toolbox](http://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/put-your-programming-tools-in-a-toolbox) post.
